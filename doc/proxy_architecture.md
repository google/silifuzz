# SiliFuzz proxy architecture

This document describes the desirable state of proxy/filtering/making
configuration. We are optimizing for:

*   Configuration simplicity and reproducibility across different proxies.
*   Number of memory mappings that will be created at runtime. Fewer is better.

### Fuzzing

##### Memory mappings

Establish a single executable page inside the following virtual address range

1.  `[0x30000000; 0xB0000000)` (*CODE*)

Establish read/write 2 data mappings 0.5Gb each in different parts of the
address space.

1.  `[0x10000, 0x20010000)` (*DATA1*)
1.  `[0x1000010000, 0x1020010000)` (*DATA2*)

Two desirable properties that these mappings should satisfy are:

*   a single instruction, e.g. a bit set, can translate an address from one
    mapping to an address of another mapping
*   one mapping resides in the lower 2Gb and the other does not

The combined size of all *CODE* and *DATA* mappings must stay below 3Gb to limit
per-runner memory footprint. The actual upper limit is machine specific and
depends on the RAM/CPU ratio.

NOTE: In reality runners share a lot of pages with the orchestrator and
therefore the limit is higher but we are being conservative.

During fuzzing, the proxy will create the *DATA* mappings with the corresponding
prot bits and place a single page in the *CODE* range at the address based on
the content hash of the instruction sequence.

This setup guarantees each input can only read and execute a single page of code
and read/write anywhere inside the *DATA* regions during fuzzing.

##### Initial register state

Ideally, we want the initial state to be as simple as possible which is
everything set to 0. In practice this is not possible for a variety of platform
and proxy-specific reasons.

The program counter (`PC`) and the stack pointer (`SP`) registers must always be
initialized accordingly. The `PC` is always set to the first byte of the
instruction sequence (`CODE_PAGE_start`). The stack pointer is always set to
`DATA1_limit`.

All other registers must be consistently initialized across fuzzing and the
subsequent filtering/making stages of the pipeline.

NOTE: On X86_64 at least the following registers must be non-zero: `%cs`, `%ss`
and `%xmm0`. The two segment selectors are set by the kernel to 0x33 and 0x2b
for userspace. The xmm register is a workaround for
[erratum 1386](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/56683-PUB-1.07.pdf)

TODO(ncbray): Document AArch64 requirements.

##### Expected end state

For any input instruction sequence with size X the expected PC value is
`CODE_PAGE_start+X`. Expected register and memory states are undefined.

### Filtering and making

At the filter phase (which is executed on the target hardware during fuzzing)
the code will be similarly placed inside the *CODE* region but no *DATA*
mappings will be created initially. Instead, the filter will perform snapshot
expansion (i.e. map new pages) as needed with the added restriction that all
reads/writes must happen inside the *DATA* regions. The result of this process
is a corpus of snapshots that can only access the predefined *CODE* and *DATA*
address ranges.

The make stage will be similarly augmented to ensure all memory accesses are
inside the predefined regions.

### Running

To minimize the number of memory mappings created by each runner we can pre-map
the *CODE* mapping as a single mapping. Similarly, we can coalesce adjacent
mappings inside the *DATA* regions and map them in a single `mmap()` call. These
measures can dramatically reduce the number of memory mappings each runner
creates from O(snapshots_per_shard) to O(1).

On the downside, this optimization makes large contiguous chunks of memory
accessible to every snapshot and potentially reduces the runnerâ€™s ability to
detect SDCs (e.g. detecting accesses to memory outside of the declared
mappings). To reduce the chances of this we can poke holes in the *CODE* and
*DATA* regions with `PROT_NONE` pages until we reach some predefined maximum
number of mappings.
