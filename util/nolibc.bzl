"""Provides nolibc build rules.

... these work like cc_library, cc_binary and cc_test rules but are used for
defining targets that use Silifuzz's own libraries instead of the standard libc and
C++ runtime libs. The cc_*_nolibc rules define a target for the nolibc environment.
The actual target name is suffxied with "_nolibc". The cc_*_plus_nolibc rules
define both kinds targets.

We use this method instead of adding a config_setting() for nolibc so that
we can generate a _nolibc binary in the same build as normal binaries and
easily integration-test the two kinds.
