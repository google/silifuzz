This package provides a library, called libpfm4 which is used to develop
monitoring tools exploiting the performance monitoring events such as those
provided by the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) of modern processors.

This is a complete rewrite of libpfm3 and it is NOT backward compatible
with it.

Libpfm4 helps convert from an event name, expressed as a string, to 
the event encoding that is either the raw event as documented by HW vendor
or the OS-specific encoding. In the latter case, the library is able to
prepare the OS-specific data structures needed by the kernel to setup the
event.

The current libpfm4 provides support for the perf_events interface which was
introduced in Linux v2.6.31. Perfmon support is not present yet.

The library does not make any performance monitoring system calls. It is
portable and supports other operating system environments beyond Linux,
such as Mac OS X, and Windows.

The library supports many PMUs. The current version can handle:

WHAT'S THERE
-------------
	- the library source code including support for all processors listed
	  above

	- a set of generic examples showing how to list and query events. They
	  are in examples.

	- a set of examples showing how the library can be used with the
	  perf_events interface. They are in perf_examples.

	- a set of library header files used to compile the library and
	  perf_examples

	- man pages for all the library entry points

	- Python bindings for the library

	- a SPEC file to build RPMs from the library

	- the Debian-style config file to build a .deb package from the library

INSTALLATION
------------
	- edit config.mk to :
		- update some of the configuration variables
		- select your compiler options

	- type make
	- type make install

	- The default installation location is /usr/local. You can specify
	  a diffierent install location as follows:
	        $ make PREFIX=<install-dir> install
	  Depending on your install location, you may need to run the 'ldconfig'
	  command or use LD_LIBRARY_PATH when you build and run tools that
	  link to the libpfm4 library.

	- By default, libpfm library files are installed in <install-dir>/lib.
	  If 'make' builds 64-bit libraries on your system, and your target
	  architecture expects 64-bit libraries to be located in a library
	  named "lib64", then you should use the LIBDIR variable when installing,
	  as follows:
	        $ make LIBDIR=<install-dir>/lib64 install

 	- To compile and install the Python bindings, you need to go to the
	  python sub-directory and type make. Python may not be systematically
	  built.

	- to compile the library for another ABI (e.g. 32-bit x86 on a
	  64-bit x86) system, you can pass the ABI flag to the compiler as
	  follows (assuming you have the multilib version of gcc):
		$ make OPTIM="-m32 -O2"

PACKAGING
---------
	The library comes with the config files necessary to generate RPMs or
	Debian packages. The source code produces 3 packages:
	- libpfm : runtime library
	- libpfm-dev: development files (headers, manpages, static library)
	- libpfm-python: Python bindings for the library

	To generate the RPMs:
	$ rpmbuild -ba libpfm.spec

	To generate the Debian packages:
	$ debuild -i -us -uc -b

	You may need to install some extra packages to make Debian package
	generation possible.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
	- to run the programs in the perf_examples subdir, you MUST be using a
	  linux kernel with perf_events. That means v2.6.31 or later.

	- to compile the Python bindings, you need to have SWIG and the python
	  development packages installed

	- To compile on Windows, you need the MinGW and MSYS compiler environment
	  (see www.mingw.org). The environment needs to be augmented with the
	  mingw regex user contributed package (mingw-libgnurx-2.5.1.dev.tar.gz).

	- To compile on Mac OS X, you need to have gmake installed.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
	- man pages for all entry points. It is recommended you start with: man libpfm
	- More information can be found on library web site:
